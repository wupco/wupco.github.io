My name is Yuhang Wu, a first-year PhD student advised by Dr. <a href="http://xinyuxing.org/">Xinyu Xing</a> in Northwestern University. I major in network/system security. 
I used to research on Web security and I had participated in many security competitions (CTFs) in which I solve Web challenges with my teammates of <a href="https://nu1l.com/">Nu1L</a>(<a href="https://strawhat.team/">Straw Hat</a>) and Tea Deliverers. I have provided some challenges for well-known worldwide CTF competitions(<a href="https://realworldctf.com/">Realworld CTF</a>, <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf/240/">N1CTF</a>, etc.). Before joining Northwestern University, I interned at Penn State University for one year.
