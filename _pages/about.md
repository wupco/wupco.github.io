My name is Yuhang Wu, a first year PhD student advised by <a href="http://xinyuxing.org/">Xinyu Xing</a> in Northwestern university. I am majoring in network/system security and have some practical experience in this field. 
I used to researching on Web security and I had participated in many competitions about security(CTFs[capture the flag]) to solve Web challenges with my teammates of <a href="https://nu1l.com/">Nu1L</a>(<a href="https://strawhat.team/">Straw Hat</a>) and Tea Deliverers. I have provided some challenges for well-known worldwide CTF competitions(RealwordCTF, N1CTF, etc.). I also had a one-year internship at Penn state university as a researcher.
